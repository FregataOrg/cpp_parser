# Iteration 1 Summary: Project Setup and Discovery Module

**Goals:**

1. Set up project structure and dependencies.
2. Implement basic CMake integration to generate `compile_commands.json`.
3. Create file discovery functionality to identify all C/C++ files.

**Status:** Completed

**Challenges and Decisions:**

- **Compiler ID File Filtering:** We faced significant challenges in filtering out compiler ID files from the file discovery process. Initially, we attempted to filter based on file path and directory name analysis of `compile_commands.json`. However, these methods proved unreliable as `compile_commands.json` consistently included compiler ID files.
    - **Decision:** We decided to simplify the file discovery logic and rely solely on directory scanning of the `src` and `include` directories within the project. This approach, while bypassing `compile_commands.json` for file discovery, provided a more robust and predictable way to identify project source and header files, avoiding the inclusion of compiler ID files. We will still use `compile_commands.json` in later iterations for extracting compiler flags and include paths.

- **Duplicate File Paths:** We initially encountered duplicate file paths in the discovered source files.
    - **Decision:** We used Python sets to store file paths, ensuring uniqueness, and then converted the sets to sorted lists for consistent output.

- **Path Handling:** We needed to ensure that file paths were consistently relative to the project root.
    - **Decision:** We used `os.path.relpath` to normalize all file paths to be relative to the project directory.

**Improvements for Iteration 2:**

- **Unit Tests:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for the project discovery module to ensure its robustness and correctness.
- **Compiler Flag Extraction:** In Iteration 2, we will focus on robustly extracting compiler flags and include paths from `compile_commands.json` and associate them with the discovered source files. This information will be crucial for accurate semantic parsing in later iterations.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Improve error handling and logging throughout the project discovery module to provide more informative feedback to the user in case of issues.

**Conclusion:**

Iteration 1 successfully established the project structure and implemented a basic file discovery module. While we faced challenges with filtering compiler ID files and ensuring accurate file discovery, we made informed decisions to simplify the approach and prioritize robustness. The directory scanning-based file discovery, combined with the `extract_compile_info` function for compile information extraction, provides a solid foundation for the next iterations. We are now ready to move on to Iteration 2, focusing on semantic parsing with Clang, after implementing unit tests for the current module.
